<h1> Bounce </g1>
<h2> what </h2>
A bounce is when you jump or otherwise get launched away from a 1u (under certain circumstances 2u) tele due to a design decision to "pseudo-land" when 1-3u above the ground. This "pseudo-land" allows you to perform grounded actions without touching the ground, like jumping and walking.

There are many different terms for this:
<ul>
<li>Uncrouched Bounce: a rocket hits the ground on the same tick as you pseudo-land, uncrouched</li>
<li>Crouched Bounce: a rocket hits the ground on the same tick as you pseudo-land, crouched</li>
<li>Bounce Hop (or bhop): jump on the tick that you pseudo-land; not quite the same thing as a "normal" bhop</li>
<li>Power Bounce (pb): a bounce hop, but also crouch and shoot to do a rocket jump</li>
</ul>
<h2>how</h2>
For normal bounces, you need to fire the rocket such that it reaches the ground at the same time as you. Since players fall &#8733; t^2 and rockets move at a constant velocity, this means that you need to fire at the same time as you land for short distances, and before you hit 1100ups if you reach that speed.

Note that crouched bounces usually send the player too high to stabilize and pogo afterwards, but uncrouched bounces and bhops are fine.

For bouncehops, most players will bind +jump to mwheeldown and mwheelup. This is not consistent, but is enough when only one is needed and/or it's not too far into a jump.

For PBs, you'll want to use spacebar instead of the mousewheel since you also need to time the crouch/shoot inputs to go right after the bhop.
<h2>why</h2>
Some jumps are designed for these tricks, others are easier with them (mostly wallpogo maps). Any time you see a 1u tele on a hard/long jump, check if there are any convenient setups.

<h1>Setups</h1>
<h2>what</h2>
In order to bounce, you must spend a tick before landing between 1-3u above the ground. Since the game runs at 66 ticks/second and units are fairly small (soldier ground speed is 240u/s), most of the time you won't be able to do a bounce.

Since gravity is constant (until 3500u/s in any given axis), it is possible to say that certain <i>heights</i> are bounceable; if you walk off of a ledge that's exactly 691u over the ground (690u over the tele), you will always be able to do an uncrouched bounce (or bhop). This is very important! Consider all the ways that you can manipulate your starting position, or alternatively, the apex of your jump or the point you start falling after anything that sets your y velocity to 0:
<ul>
<li>Walk off</li>
<li>Crouch walk off</li>
<li>Jump off</li>
<li>Crouch jump off</li>
<li>Ctap off</li>
</ul>
If we allow ourselves to shoot the starting platform, we get more options:
<ul>
<li>Shoot straight down (crouched/uncrouched/midcrouch)</li>
<li>Walk forward and shoot down (crouched/uncrouched)</li>
<li>Walk backward and shoot down (crouched/uncrouched)</li>
<li>Walk (left/right) and shoot down (crouched/uncrouched)</li>
<li>Walk diagonally (...) and shoot down (crouched/uncrouched) (Unreliable!)</li>
</ul>
When you add in that there are 3 different rocket launchers in terms of rocket starting location, this gives many different possible y offsets to our starting location. What makes these work is that each option (except diagonals) is completely non-random and easy to perform. As such, most heights will have some kind of "special start" to allow you to start a jump with a bounce if there is a nearby 1u tele.

<h2>Mid-jump:</h2>
All of the above options only work from standing still, some of them only on a shootable platform. Thus, they're all useless midway through a jump. However, there are some tricks that work from a dynamic start:
<ul>
<li>Edgebug</li>
<li>Headbonk (ceilingsmash, etc.)</li>
<li>Wallbug</li>
</ul>
An edgebug start is equivalent to a walkoff; headbonks have an offset relative to a walkoff equal to player height (83u). In the rare opportunity that you have the option to wallbug over a surface that you want to bounce off of, you can manipulate the wallbug until you're facing at the bounce surface and drop slowly until you reach a walkoff height (diabarha last).

<h2>bcheck</h2>
bcheck is a plugin on the Tempus servers that allows you to check your current height relative to a surface; this is given as the difference between the y position of the bottom of your player assuming you're standing up and the y position of the targeted surface. Alternatively, you can choose two surfaces. The plugin also shows most non-shooting setups and allows checking for ceiling setups. This is your friend; the wallbug trick does not work at all without bcheck.

<h2>Angle bhops</h2>
An "angle bhop" abuses the fact that
<ol>
<li>There is a terminal velocity</li>
<li>There is more precision in the angle you can look than is needed for the +/- 0.5u accuracy needed for a bounce height</li>
</ol>
With any rocket launcher, given the vertical distance between the start and end, there is at least one angle range that you can shoot at while standing xor crouched such that you reach a bounce height. These ranges are typically small (+/- 0.02 degrees vertical), and so you'll want a toggle bind to go down to extremely low sens for the setup. Generally, other special starts are easier and faster, moreso if loadout swap binds are used to utilize multiple rocket launcher's options.

<h1>Jumpbugs</h1>
The jump bug (JB) has been in source/gldsrc games for a long time. When you uncrouch in the air, you instantaneously go from your crouched collision hull to your uncrouched collision hull. We only care about the bottom face of that box, which moves down about 7 units in that tick. If you uncrouch into a bounce height (1-2u off the ground), you can jump (or do a normal bounce). This can "penetrate" a much higher tele; always at least 6u. The limit for how high of a tele this works on comes from the maximum upward speed a jump can give you; otherwise you hit the tele on the way up.

Note, you can't do a crouched PB from a JB; the requirement that you uncrouch at the same time as jumping delays the next crouch.

Also, a jumpbug will negate all fall damage.

<h2>Jumpbug heights</h2>
Any uncrouched bounce height is also a JB height. Additionally, those JB heights extend an extra unit shallower (e.g. 1202-1202.99 is a walkoff uncrouched bounce; anything from 1201-1202.99 is a walkoff jumpbug).

<h1>Random bounces</h1>
Due to the chaotic nature of jumping (there are a <i>very large</i> number of fine-grained timing/angle "choices" that make up a given jump attempt), it is wholly unreasonable to know whether or not you will pseudo land without a setup. Nonetheless, it's still fully possible; these are called random bounces (and they really might as well be random, despite being deterministic). Many jumps can be cheated (or can only be completed!) with a conveniently placed random PB (ex. jump_aten hole) instead of a consistent, but harder execution jump (headbonk crouched bounce -> wallshot). This is also almost invariably faster than intended, so many bonuses rely on random bounces.
<br /><br />
Note: bounce heights are noticeably "denser" at low speeds/starting heights. For example, they are spaced every ~10u at around 350u, but only one per 52.5u at terminal velocity.

<h2>Random PB from pogo</h2>
The most consistent/useful setup for a random bounce is to pogo in place, attempting to jump->crouch and shoot on consecutive ticks just before landing. If you time it too early, you'll just continue pogoing. Pogoing in place keeps the bottom face of your collision hull about 100-150u from the ground, so the odds of pogoing to a bounce height are about 1/7.
