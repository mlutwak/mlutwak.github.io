<h1>Edgebug</h1>
If you land on the edge of a platform on the same tick as you slide off, you do not register as landing. This means:
<ul>
<li>No fall damage</li>
<li>You don't get teleported if there was a tele on the platform</li>
<li>You don't lose any horizontal speed</li>
<li>But you DO lose all vertical speed</li>
</ul>

Usually, their purpose in a map is obvious OR it's a difficult means of getting slightly more distance/slowing down in a vertical strafe jump. Most exceptions are edgesyncs in horizontal hole jumps.
<br /><br />
Edgebugs can be useful as a setup for bounces, walkoff or crouch walkoff height (jump_crypt).

<br /><br />

Edgebugs which happen at bounce heights also cause you to enter walking (or crouch walking), which slows your speed despite avoiding teles.
