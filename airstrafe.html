<h1>Airstrafe</h1>
<h2>what</h2>
There are two types of unassisted aerial movement in TF2: air strafing and air control. Airstrafes are much more powerful and more relevant to non-wallpogo jumps.

While airborn, one or two movement keys (WASD) can be meaningfully held at once. When turning <i>sufficiently slowly</i>, the player can be considered to be moving in a circle around an axis parallel to the y axis in the direction that the strafe keys point. For a given forward velocity, there is a specific turning rate at which forward velocity is constant. For a lower turning rate, the player accelerates forward; at a higher rate, the player slows down.

The svar airaccelerate determines how "strong" airstrafes are, and accordingly how quickly you can turn at a given velocity without losing speed. By default this is set to 10; surf servers use anywhere from 100-1000. sv_airaccelerate only exists through Sourcemod for TF2.

The specific mechanism at work is similar to the analog in id engine games like Q3, but much stronger and with a different axis. CPMA physics are much closer to Source.

<h2>why</h2>
Changing direction is good, maintaining speed while doing so is better. Many jumps are difficult/slow entirely because of how quickly the player can turn 180 degrees without losing speed.

<h2>Wiggling</h2>
Airstrafes increase forward speed. You can strafe back and forth while maintaining a nearly straight path to gain speed without deviating substantially from the shortest path forward to go further or faster. This is a mechanical skill which can "save" many attempts or allow for skipping entire jumps on occasion.

<h1>Air control</h1>
<h2>what</h2>
Without turning, the strafe keys impact aerial movement. This "push force" is air control, which determines how quickly you can stop moving in the air (holding S) as well as how much strafing is needed to wallpogo. Notably, Mantreads give increased air control, not airaccel. Downpogo especially is much easier with Mantreads, not that it's relevant for Tempus.
